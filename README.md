# IndiText-Boost
Text Augmentation for Low Resource India Languages


## Abstract
This research paper addresses the importance of data augmentation in NLP, specifically focusing on text classification. The study emphasizes the need for data augmentation techniques tailored for Indian languages, such as Hindi and Marathi, where limited research has been conducted. The project aims to adapt approaches like Easy Data Augmentation, Back Translation, Paraphrasing, and Document Generation for Indian languages. The proposed methodologies show promising results in improving binary and multiclass classification tasks across different languages. Further experimentation, including larger datasets and ensemble models, is recommended for future research. Overall, this work contributes to solving the problem of data scarcity in various NLP tasks and provides a valuable resource for selecting the most effective data augmentation techniques for Indian languages.
